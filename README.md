Welcome to my repository of university notes, compiled throughout my coursework in Computer Science and Mathematics at Northeastern University. This collection includes lecture notes, summaries, and study guides from various semesters, organized by subject and date. 

I started these notes in my second year so I don't have previous notes on here (though I might add them if I feel like). 

I'm still getting into the swing of writing notes and then adding them here but I will hopefully get better at that.

**Note** Currently, this repository only contains my lecture notes from my Theory of Computation and Intensive Math Reasoning classes, as well as my notes on the textbook Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi. Depending on further professor consent I will hopefully be able to add my notes for Object-Oriented Design and Advanced Probability & Statistics. This repository also does not include any commits from when my code was private as they contain sensitive information.

**Note:** The homework and solutions in this repository are my own work, shared for educational purposes only. Please do not submit them as your own in any academic context. These notes also do not exactly represent the opinions or teaching of any professors as everything is my interpretation.

If you find any errors, have suggestions, or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out or open an issue on GitHub.
