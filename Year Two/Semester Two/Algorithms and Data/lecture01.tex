\section{January 9, Introduction}
\subsection{What is CS3000: Algorithms and Data}
The study of how to solve computational problems.
\begin{itemize}
  \item How to design \textbf{efficient algorithms} - Resources: time, space, parallelism
\end{itemize}
Why do we care about this?
\begin{itemize}
  \item Improve your problem solving
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How to attack new problems
    \item Which algorithmic tools apply
    \item How to compare different solutions
    \item How to know if a solution is the best possible
  \end{itemize}
  \item etc
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Egg Drop Contest}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You want to test your egg parachute (one egg, ladder with n steps)
  \item You can try dropping your egg odd different steps to see if it breaks
\end{itemize}
Linear scan
\begin{lstlisting}
  LinearScan(1,n):
  H = 0
  While H <= n and egg intact
    H = H + 1
    Drop egg from step H
  
  Return H - 1
\end{lstlisting}
Worst case number of steps: n
\\
Now with two eggs: start in the middle and if it breaks 
\begin{lstlisting}
  BalancedScan(1,n):
    H = 0
    While H <= n and first egg intact
      H = H + n^1/2
      Drop egg from step H
    If first egg intact:
      Return n
    Else:
      LinearScan(H - n^1/2 + 1, H - 1)
\end{lstlisting}
Worst case time $2 \sqrt{n}$
\\
Suppose you have some $t \in \mathbb{N}$ eggs.
\\
With t eggs you can get a worst case of $tn^{1/t}$
\\
With $\infty$ eggs, use binary search for worst case $log_2(n)$

\subsection{The Chocolate Coin Problem}
You have a sack of n coins, one is chocolate and lighter.
Use a scale to see which of the two is heavier
