\section{1/21 - Specification cont.}
We might use a comment to annotate a function;
\begin{lstlisting}
  (* return the larger of the two numbers *)
  let max (i : int) (j : int) = ...
\end{lstlisting}
This can be written as $S = \{P \vert P $ implements "return the larger of two numbers" $\}$
\\
This is somewhat ambiguous, the set is infinite.
\begin{lstlisting}
  (* sorts the input list *)
  let rec sort (xs : int list) = ...

  type row = {
    name : string;
    gid : string; (* global id *)
    lid : string (* local id *)
  }

  let rec sort_rows (xs : row list) : row list = ...
\end{lstlisting}
It's unclear how this needs to be sorted.
\\
A data type is its own specification. $S = \{ P \vert P \text{ has int list} \to \text{int list} \}$. This set is also infinite.
\\
We want something more powerfull then the second while still expressing the meaning of the first.
\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\forall xs, ys, \: \text{sort xs} = ys \implies \forall i, j, 0 \leq i < j < \text{length }ys \implies ys[i] \leq ys[j]$
  \item $\forall x, \: x \in ys \land x \in xs$ 
  \\
  or $\forall xs, ys, \text{sort xs = ys} \implies \forall i, |xs\{i\}| = |ys\{i\}|$
\end{enumerate}
We can restate this as $S = \{ P \vert \forall i, R(i, P(i))\}$.
